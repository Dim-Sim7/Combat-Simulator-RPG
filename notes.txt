combat system:

real-time

what does the player do?

choose to auto-attack, cast spell, use item, run away

what does the enemy do?

    ai combat. It randomly chooses to auto attack or cast. if low on health it heals or uses potion.
    if npc is humanoid it will run away at low health (run away, 10% chance to escape combat. While running, enemy cannot use an action)


what methods do i need?

    battleLoop (player, enemy)

    while either not dead

    **need to figure out how to listen to events from player (what action they chose to do)

    enemy will continually be doing attacks

    need to determine if a spell is off cooldown, if they can attack (based on weapon speed)

    when an enemy dies, the player can loot it. Can drop gold, potions or other things based off the loot table of the npc

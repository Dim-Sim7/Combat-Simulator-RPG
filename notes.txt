LOOT TABLE:
    assign drop chances based on item
    given the level on a monster, "drop" appropriate loot
    loot data is saved on a csv. 

EQUIPSLOTS:
    a player can open their inventory and equip loot or use consumables
    a player can look at their equippable slots (Head, cloak etc...)

After these, need to do major testing and documentation on code

need to make sure i can make players, enemies and that combat works. (can just do in the command line at this point)
After all this, everything is pretty much done. Just need to link python scraper, save npc, item and spell data into csvs. Csvs need to be in a specific structure of headers
Then need to figure out how to make the gameplay.

Eventually, I want to render a simple pointcloud game (idk if possible at this point). Move through random dungeons, battle point cloud enemies, open chests, level up etc...




when an enemy dies, the player can loot it. Can drop gold, potions or other things based off the loot table of the npc

Implement loot function, equip slots,

need to test what I have now (will do after making items)
when I equip an item I need to adjust the player's stats - can do this in a class called EquipSlots

a player has equip slots. Items in the equip slots modify the player's stats.

a character sheet holds all the equipslots. When an item is equipped, the player's stats are updated (how? a continuously running method, or an update method?)

IMPLEMENT STATSMOD, BASESTATS

INVENTORY:
    add, remove, print

NEED TO IMPLEMENT:

inventory

LOOT TABLE. On enemy death, drop randomised loot
player loot function from dead enemy

testing of what i already have
figure out how to render a window with char sprites and random dungeons
render enemies. build a simple UI for combat, inventory, character sheet, equip items, loot slain enemies, loot chests.

spellbook to display spells.

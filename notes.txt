Last implemented:
    cast time waiting for spells
    refactored attack, cast spell and others from npc, player into entity base class (they were the same)
    finish battlesystem.h




Items
 each item modifies some stat.
each item has a statModifier struct. It changes the struct based on the items effect
(health pot, increase health) (armor, increase armor + increase maxHealth)








when an enemy dies, the player can loot it. Can drop gold, potions or other things based off the loot table of the npc

Implement loot function, equip slots,

need to test what I have now (will do after making items)
when I equip an item I need to adjust the player's stats - can do this in a class called EquipSlots

a player has equip slots. Items in the equip slots modify the player's stats.

a character sheet holds all the equipslots. When an item is equipped, the player's stats are updated (how? a continuously running method, or an update method?)

IMPLEMENT STATSMOD, BASESTATS

INVENTORY:
    add, remove, print

NEED TO IMPLEMENT:

item types (weapon, armor, consumable)

LOOT TABLE. On enemy death, drop randomised loot
player loot function from dead enemy

different item types.
testing of what i already have
figure out how to render a window with char sprites and random dungeons
render enemies. build a simple UI for combat, inventory, character sheet, equip items, loot slain enemies, loot chests.
